By integrating digital sensors and IoT devices, farmers can collect real-time data on weather, soil conditions, air temperature, and pest activity. This information is then analyzed through monitoring systems, enabling more precise decision-making in farming practices. The use of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, coupled with digital sensors, facilitates continuous monitoring and control of the hydroponic environment, providing valuable insights into optimal crop growth conditions. Additionally, IoT-driven automation manages tasks such as controlling heaters, irrigation systems, and pest control based on real-time data, enhancing efficiency, and promoting resource optimization in agriculture.
